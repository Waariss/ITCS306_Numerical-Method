Write 3 programs that 

1. take a square-root of a number n using the heron's method and digit adding method taught in class : test with the square root of 19 (n = 19).  Use stopping criterion to stop your program.
2. convert a floating point number (base-10) into IEEE-754 and test with the floating point number (base-10) 58.5625.
3. convert a 32-bit binary string in IEEE-754 format into a decimal floating point number (base-10) and test with the floating point number (base-10) 58.5625

Note that the binary value for 58.5625 in IEEE-754 (for checking purpose) is 
s = 0
e = 1000 0100
f = 1101 0100 1000 .... 0
