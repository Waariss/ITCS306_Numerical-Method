Code the following 3 programs

1a A program that can take a square root of a number using Taylor Series expansion method.   Stop the iteration of the program using stopping criterion.  Test with the square root of the number 58.25. 

1b. A program that can take a cube root of a number using Taylor Series expansion method.   Stop the iteration of the program using stopping criterion.  Test with the square root of the number 58.25. 

2. A program that can evaluate the value of natural log of 11025 using Taylor Series expansion method.  Given that you can find the value of e by setting e = limit (1+(1/n))^n as n approaches infinity.   Stop the iteration of the program using stopping criterion.  Test your result with a calculator.  (Hint: you cannot apply natural log (1+x) formula directly since the formula requires |x| < 1 - refer to the radius of convergence topic I mentioned in class.  Instead, you can split the number 11025 into two numbers a and b where a * b = 11025 and make sure a is exp(k) and |b| < 1.  Then apply basic log property: log(a * b) = log(a) + log(b) and log(exp(k)) = k

3. Find the n-term approximation of a function (T_n(x)) of sin(x) where n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.  Plot T_n(x) against sin(x) in the way similar to the figure in slide 34.
